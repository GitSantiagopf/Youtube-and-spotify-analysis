# Youtube and spotify analysis

This is an exploratory analysis and visualization of songs on YouTube and Spotify, using data science tools to examine music listening trends. In this project, visualizations have been created to effectively represent the results.

The analysis focuses on several key aspects of music, such as the most played songs, how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements such as tempo, beat stability, beat strength and overall regularity, whether the song is available on Spotify as a single or included in an album, whether the song represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity Graphs and charts are used to visualize the results clearly and concisely, allowing users to quickly understand patterns and trends in the data.

This project is useful for both music lovers and researchers interested in studying music consumption patterns. The results obtained can be used to inform music professionals, artists, producers and record labels about the popularity of certain genres and songs, which will help them make informed career decisions.
